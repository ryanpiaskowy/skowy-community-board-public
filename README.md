## Description

This image based events calendar is designed to serve as a community events board. The idea came from there being so many local events, but most online community event calendars are text based leaving out one of the most important factors when deciding to go to the event: **the vibes**

Enter the event flyer.  

Event creators spend so much time designing the flyer for the event deciding what specific information possible eventgoers would need and portraying what the event is all about (vibes). These flyers are so often hidden from the web. I wanted a way that event creators can showcase their flyer! Selfishly, I wanted a way to keep track of all of the fun events, while also keeping knowing the vibe of the event based on the flyer. Hope ya'll like it!
